## Introduction  
As part of a conversation, a few of us were wondering what it was that made countries to be happy...  Yes, Norway, Sweden, Finland, etc are all scoring "high" but what makes them that way?  What are the common denominators?  Is there something in just their culture or their constitions?  

Still working on it - the week has been a tad off the rails.  

Still off the rails.

Still debugging.
